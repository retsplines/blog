It's about time I got a blog. 

I work on so much stuff, and part of the fun of that is to write about it.

So here we go. If you follow me on the [Fediverse](https://furry.engineer/@ret) you'll probably have seen some of the things I'll be writing about here already. You can look forward to the occasional teardowns and photos of random bits of kit, reverse-engineering, programming and more.

When I've blogged in the past, I've usually tried to aim for polished, perfectly published content, but I feel like that always led me to lose interest & energy for posting. Here, you can expect slightly rougher posts, but maybe that might mean you'll see content more often.
