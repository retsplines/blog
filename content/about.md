# About

I'm [Ret](https://furry.engineer/@ret), a [Folf](https://en.wikifur.com/wiki/Folf) on the Internet. This is my blog, *Fox/Dog*.

I mostly write about electronics, radio & software experiments I'm working on or have done.

If you want to contact me, you can mail `hello` at the domain of this blog and I'll do my best to get back to you.

I'll be updating this page with my PGP public key soon.
